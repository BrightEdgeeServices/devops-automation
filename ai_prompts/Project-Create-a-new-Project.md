Create the text for a project in Linear (www.https://linear.app/):

# Project Description:

1. Clearly define the purpose of this project:
1. What problem does it solve:
1. What’s the expected outcome:
1. What are the features of this project:
1. What does success look like? (e.g. performance improvements, customer adoption, business impact):
1. Scope & Constraints
1. In Scope: [Define what’s included in this project]
1. Out of Scope: [List what is explicitly excluded]
1. Technical Constraints: [Mention any relevant limitations]
1. Dependencies: [List any dependencies on other teams, services, or vendors]
1. Deployment & Rollout Considerations:
   1. Are multiple modules/repo's involved?
   1. Does the interaction between the modules/repos require special attention?
   1. Is there a specific sequence?
1. Post-Launch & Monitoring:

- What should be monitored after implementation and for how long?

1. Recommendations you require:

# Instructions

1. Make recommendations of your own that will add value.
1. The "Summary Description" should be less than 30 words.
1. "Description and Objective" are on a high level in words.
1. "Key Features / Deliverables" are the "Description and Objectives" above broken into measurable tasks/items.
1. "Success Criteria" define high-level measurable outcomes that determine whether "Key Features / Deliverables" are completed.
1. Keep it as high-level as possible.
1. Add more items to any of the headings in the template below if you think it is necessary
1. Do not resort to using sub-bullets under subheadings in the template headings. All items must be at the top level.
1. Generate the milestones for the project.
1. Write the output to a Markdown file in the "legacy" directory on the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
1. Name the file "Project Documentation and Milestones"
1. The milestones should be designed as follows:

- The first milestones are the development and/or documentation milestones
- The last four milestones should be: "Local End-to-end testing", "Preprod Deployment and Testing", "Prod Deployment" and "Post-Launch & Monitoring"
- Milestone naming convention: "Milestone \[x\]: [Description]" where "Milestone" is fixed text, "[x]" is a sequential number and "[Description]" is a description for the milestone in less than seven words.

# Use the following template headings to generate the text for the Linear project:

- Project Title
- Summary Description
- Description and Objective
- Key Features / Deliverables
- Success Criteria
- Deployment & Rollout Plan
- Milestones
