## Deployment

### High Level Process Description

1. Push the changes until you are satisfied with your changes. Use `pushpy.ps1`. Monitor GutHub Actions. The workflow
   must complete successfully.
1. Generate the ReleaseNotes and do `pushpy.ps1`.
1. Deploy the changes by executing `pushpr.ps1`. Monitor GutHub Actions for successful deployment.

### Detail Process

1. Run the `pushpy.ps1` script or manually commit the current changes. Run it until (repeatedly) all changes are satisfied.
1. Generate the release notes. Can be generated repeatedly until all changes are accounted for in the ReleaseNotes. However, might be necessary to consolidate multiple runs into one ReleaseNote update.
   published.
   1. By using the following AI prompt in your favourite AI tool like Cursor, Junie or Codex:

      ```
      - Compile the release notes and add them to the top of the ReleaseNotes.md file by comparing the differences between the current branch and the master branch.
      - Choose appropriate headings to group the changes.
      - Bump the version appropriately in the pyproject.toml file using the SemVer (semver.org) rules.
      - If an existing script in the templates directory changes, it is a "major" version bump.
      - If a new script is added to the templates directory, it is a "minor" version bump.
      - Any changes to an existing script in the .github/workflow directory is a "patch" version bump.
      - Any addition of a new script in the .github/workflow directory is a "minor" version bump.
      - Any other changes than the above, you decide on the bump.
      - Follow the same format for the new clause as the previous clauses in the ReleaseNotes.md
      - The new notes must end with a divider to separate it from the previous release notes.
      - Do not mention the chore "dummy.txt" that was deleted.
      - The last section must be a summary of the statistics which include the names of the files that was changed, number of files that was changed, number of insertions, number of deletions and the branch name.
      ```

      or

   1. Use the following template and manually update the ReleaseNotes.md file.

      ```
       # Release ?.?.?
       ## Summary of Changes
       - bla, bla, bla
       ## Next Heading
       - bla, bla, bla
       ---
      ```
1. Run the `pushpr.ps1` script once you are ready to create the PR to publish the release. You can also manually create the tag, touch a file, commit and push the changes.
1. Merge the PR in GitHub.

## Repository Structure

- `.github/workflows/`
  - Contains the actual workflow files.
  - Workflow names starting with digits are designated for this repository and should not be reused.
- `templates/` - Contains template files for users to copy into their projects.

## Usage

Each template workflow in `templates/` kick-off a reusable workflow in this repository's
`.github/workflows/` directory.
Each reusable workflow is designed to string together the desired combination of
tasks to achieve the required workflow.

Unless you are familiar with the workflow strategies, do not change the templates
or any of the workflow scripts.
Several repositories' CI/CD processes depend on these scripts and may break.
Discuss any changes with your colleagues to get consensus on any changes or additions.

## Naming Convention

- `<language>-<type>-<task>-<description>-<variation>`
  - where
    - language = `go (GoLang)` | `py (Python)`
    - type = `pc (process)` | `pub (publish)` | `temp (template)` | `wf (workflow)`
    - task = `ci (continuous integration)` | `dep (deploy)` | `precom (pre-commit) | pypi`
    - description = Short description where words are separated by "\_".
    - variation = `def (default)` | Variation description where words are separated by "\_".

## Keeping Workflows Up to date

We regularly update our workflows to improve functionality and security. To ensure you're using the latest version:

1. Periodically check this repository for new releases.
1. Review the changelog for any breaking changes or new features.
1. Update the workflow version in your project's workflow file.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project if it doesn't already exist.
1. Select the relevant template from `templates/` directory.
1. Copy the template to the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
1. Do not copy any of the workflow files from this repositories `.github/workflows` to the target repository.
