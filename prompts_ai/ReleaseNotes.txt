- Compile the release notes by summarizing the changes between the current branch and the master branch to ./ReleaseAmendment.md
- The current contents of ./ReleaseAmendment.md must be replaced with the new release notes.
- Do not quote any branch name in the release notes.
- Bump the version appropriately in the pyproject.toml file.
- The ./ReleaseAmendment.md will be prefixed to the ReleaseNotes.md file by a GitHub Actions workflow.
  - It must therefore have the same format as the clauses in the ReleaseNotes.md to be prefixed.
  - It must start with the heading "Release ?.?.?" where the "?" are replaced with the version number
  - It must end with a divider to separate it from the previous release notes.
- Do not mention the chore "dummy.txt" that was deleted.
